# business-prototypes
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This repository will hold simple prototypes of starter projects that I will display to future employers. It will contain simple UI with some backend functionality to primarily serve as a way to display my creativity and initiative to kickstart creative ideas. By making this repository public, I risk someone taking my ideas. However, it is unlikely I will implement every idea I have. Most of the ideas will be ambiguous or ones that I don't care to progress further, but can allow others to build upon. After some time, I will release each project to separate public repositories based on which license I deem necessary for each project. I have no set time limit per project, and my decision will be based on continued evaluation of life and societal circumstance.</p>
